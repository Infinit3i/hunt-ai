# Threat Hunting Artificial Intelligence

**TLDR**: *find threats and be your electronic notebook to find the enemy **5x** quicker*

HUNT-AI helps threat hunting to make sure analysts are checking their boxes and observing all possibilities that an attacker can use on their terrain. This bot will help with managing how to threat hunting while giving helpful advice and keeping track of what you have looked at. All of this knowledge is made possible from the amazing support I have been given. learning from my current role, SEC504, FOR508, 13Cubed and many more have allowed me to give this amazing information in one central location.

## Todo
- Knowledge --> t-codes
- Persistence --> t-codes
- more t-codes
- create clear section and content
- get windows setup done well so people on windows can setup their system

- have all the pre data go into the hunt data in its right section

#### REFACTORING

kept in notebook
- from
- to
- time incident
- time reported
- file/note/scheduled/registry key
- user
- t-code


## Run Testing
```
python -m unittest discover Testing
```

## VERSIONS
