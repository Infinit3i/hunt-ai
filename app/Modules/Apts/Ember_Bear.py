            "Ember Bear is a Russian state-sponsored cyber espionage group affiliated with the GRU 161st Specialist Training Center (Unit 29155). "
            "Active since at least 2020, Ember Bear has focused on Ukrainian government and telecommunications targets, and has also impacted critical infrastructure in Europe and the Americas. "
            "The group is responsible for WhisperGate, a destructive wiper campaign executed in early 2022 against Ukrainian systems. "
            "Although sometimes conflated with Saint Bear, current evidence suggests Ember Bear is a distinct operational entity with unique tactics and infrastructure."
