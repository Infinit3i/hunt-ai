        "description": "Adversaries may gather information about the victim's DNS that can be used during targeting. DNS information may include a variety of details, including registered name servers as well as records that outline addressing for a targetâ€™s subdomains, mail servers, and other hosts. DNS MX, TXT, and SPF records may also reveal the use of third party cloud and SaaS providers, such as Office 365, G Suite, Salesforce, or Zendesk. Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as querying or otherwise collecting details via DNS/Passive DNS. DNS information may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets. Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance, establishing operational resources, and/or initial access. Adversaries may also use DNS zone transfer (DNS query type AXFR) to collect all records from a misconfigured DNS server.",
