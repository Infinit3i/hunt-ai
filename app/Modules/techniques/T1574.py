        "description": "Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs. Hijacking execution flow can be used for persistence, privilege escalation, and defense evasion by loading adversary-controlled code into trusted processes.\n\nCommon techniques include DLL search order hijacking, unquoted service paths, environment variable abuse, registry manipulation, and binary replacement. The goal is to alter how the OS or application locates and loads executable code or libraries, often without detection. These hijacks may exploit file system, registry, or environmental weaknesses to insert malicious payloads.\n\nThis behavior can lead to stealthy persistence, privilege escalation, and execution of code that masquerades as legitimate system behavior. Detection relies on analyzing process behavior, file system changes, environment variables, and registry activity for anomalies that indicate execution flow redirection.",
