        "description": "Adversaries may communicate using a protocol and port pairing that is atypical or deliberately altered to bypass detection and evade network security controls. For instance, they may use HTTPS over ports like 8088 or 587 rather than the standard port 443. This technique can disrupt protocol-based detection, obfuscate malicious traffic, and hinder analysis by altering expectations around port behavior.\n\nNon-standard ports can also be configured directly on the victim system, such as altering Registry keys or other configuration settings to redirect legitimate protocols to attacker-controlled services or binaries.",
