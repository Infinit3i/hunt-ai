        "description": "Adversaries may create cloud snapshots or backups to evade detection, bypass access restrictions, or facilitate later access. A snapshot captures the state of a volume or disk at a point in time. By creating a snapshot and mounting it to a new instance under adversary-controlled policies, attackers can access sensitive data without directly compromising the original compute resource. This is commonly seen as a precursor to lateral movement or staging data for exfiltration.",
