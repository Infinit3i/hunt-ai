        "description": "Adversaries may patch the operating system of a network device in storage or runtime to weaken defenses or introduce new malicious capabilities. Network devices, such as routers and firewalls, often rely on monolithic firmware images. By tampering with this image, either on disk or in memory, attackers can embed keyloggers, disable security functions, or alter command outputs to deceive defenders.\n\nPatching may occur in two main ways:\n- **In Storage:** The attacker downloads a malicious or modified OS image using TFTP, SCP, or similar protocols, replacing the original or configuring the device to boot from the tampered version.\n- **In Memory:** Advanced adversaries may use native debug commands or bootloader implants like [ROMMONkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/004) to manipulate memory directly at runtime. This live modification is volatile unless paired with persistence techniques.\n\nMalicious patches may alter behaviors like:\n- Reporting a fake firmware version after [Downgrade System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/002)\n- Inserting [Port Knocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001), [Keylogging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001), or [Multi-hop Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/003)\n- Weakening encryption or authentication modules, as in [Weaken Encryption](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1600) or [Network Device Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/004)",
