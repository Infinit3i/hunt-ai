        "description": "Adversaries may attempt to identify the system language of a compromised host to infer the victimâ€™s geographic region. This tactic is often used to evade legal consequences or scrutiny, particularly from countries associated with strict cybercrime enforcement. Malware may inspect environment variables, registry keys, or utilize API functions to retrieve locale and language settings. For instance, adversaries may query Windows Registry keys such as `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Nls\\Language` or call API functions like `GetUserDefaultUILanguage`, `GetSystemDefaultUILanguage`, and `GetUserDefaultLangID`. On Unix-based systems, adversaries may retrieve locale values via the `locale` command or the `$LANG` environment variable.",
