        "title": "Protocol Tunneling",
        "description": "Adversaries may tunnel network communications to and from a victim system within a separate protocol to avoid detection or filtering and to reach otherwise inaccessible systems. This technique allows adversaries to encapsulate C2 traffic within protocols such as ICMP, DNS, HTTPS, or SSH to bypass security mechanisms.\n\nTunneling may conceal malicious traffic by blending into normal communications or providing an additional encryption layer. Protocol tunneling is often used alongside techniques like Dynamic Resolution (e.g., DNS-over-HTTPS) or Proxying to evade detection and maintain stealthy, persistent communication channels.",
