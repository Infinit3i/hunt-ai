        "description": "Adversaries may insert, delete, or manipulate data at rest in order to influence external outcomes or hide activity, thus threatening the integrity of the data. By manipulating stored data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making. Stored data could include various file formats, such as Office files, databases, stored emails, and custom file formats. The type of modification and impact depends on the data and the adversaryâ€™s objectives, potentially requiring specialized expertise and prolonged information gathering.",  # Simple description
