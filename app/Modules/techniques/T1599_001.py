        "description": "Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by modifying a network deviceâ€™s Network Address Translation (NAT) configuration. NAT is used by network devices like routers and firewalls to rewrite IP addresses in transit, allowing multiple systems on a private network to communicate externally.\n\nWhen attackers gain control of a boundary device, they can exploit or alter NAT rules to traverse segmentation boundaries, bypass routing restrictions, and access otherwise unreachable internal systems. This may be leveraged for lateral movement, C2 obfuscation, or data exfiltration. Even in networks not dependent on NAT, adversaries may use custom NAT configurations to evade detection by altering packet headers and obscuring the origin/destination of traffic.\n\nThis behavior can be made more persistent or covert when combined with [Patch System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001), enabling adversaries to implant malicious NAT logic directly into the OS of the network device.",
