        "description": "Adversaries may forge credential materials such as session cookies, SAML tokens, or cloud access tokens to gain unauthorized access to web applications and services. Unlike techniques that involve stealing existing credentials ([T1539](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539), [T1528](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528)), this method involves crafting **new web credentials** using acquired secrets like private keys, passwords, or API access. \n\nWeb credential forging is especially dangerous when MFA is not enforced on session validation or if the forged tokens carry elevated privileges. Examples include forging tokens using `AssumeRole` in AWS or using Zimbraâ€™s `zmprov gdpak` to impersonate any user in the domain.",
