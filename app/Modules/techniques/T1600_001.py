        "description": "Adversaries may weaken a deviceâ€™s cryptographic implementation by reducing the encryption key space, thereby drastically lowering the effort required to break the cipher and retrieve plaintext data. This reduction can be achieved by modifying the encryption algorithm or its parameters via [Modify System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601), often through commands introduced via [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008).\n\nBy reducing key size (e.g., from 2048-bit to 64-bit), attackers increase the likelihood of brute-force success, enabling traffic decryption or impersonation. This technique is particularly potent on embedded network devices like routers and firewalls where cryptographic settings can be altered in the OS image or runtime environment.",
