        "description": "Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by exploiting the order in which Windows resolves executables when a full path is not specified. If an application launches another program or utility without an explicit path (e.g., calling `net` instead of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\net.exe`), Windows follows a standard search order to locate the executable.\n\nAn adversary can take advantage of this by dropping a malicious binary named identically to the expected utility (e.g., `net.exe`, `cmd.exe`) in a directory that is searched firstâ€”typically the directory of the calling application. Due to the default search order, Windows may resolve and execute the malicious version instead of the intended system utility.\n\nAdditionally, the use of `PATHEXT` allows prioritization of extensions (`.com` before `.exe`, etc.), which can be abused to hijack execution by naming files with extensions that take precedence. This technique is commonly used for persistence or privilege escalation when the hijacked process runs with elevated permissions.",
