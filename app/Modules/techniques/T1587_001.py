        "description": "Adversaries may develop malware (e.g., payloads, droppers, backdoors, post-compromise tools, packers, C2 protocols) to maintain control of remote machines, evade defenses, and execute post-compromise behaviors. Skills required for malware development may reside in-house or be contracted out, provided the adversary maintains involvement in shaping requirements and exclusivity of the resulting malware.",  # Simple description
