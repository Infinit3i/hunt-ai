Employee names may be used to derive email addresses as well as to help guide other reconnaissance efforts and/or craft more-believable lures. Adversaries may easily gather employee names, since they may be readily available and exposed via online or other accessible data sets. Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance, establishing operational resources, and/or initial access.",
