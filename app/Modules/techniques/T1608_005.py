        "description": "Adversaries may set up malicious infrastructure that is referenced by links intended for phishing, malware delivery, or credential harvesting. This stage involves preparing the destination resources, such as cloned login pages, downloadable malware, or client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript), to manipulate the behavior and lure victims. \n\nLinks may be distributed via spearphishing emails, SMS messages, chat platforms, or embedded within websites. These links often mask their true destinations by using URL obfuscation techniques or link shorteners, sometimes hosted on legitimate platforms to bypass defenses.\n\nAdversaries may clone legitimate services or use homoglyphs and typosquatting on purchased domains to increase legitimacy. Hosting infrastructure may include traditional web servers, PaaS services, or decentralized platforms like IPFS, making takedown efforts more difficult. \n\nLink targets are foundational in enabling attacks such as credential phishing, drive-by compromise, and malware execution. These targets may also include dynamic content using single-use or one-time links to evade detection.",
