        "description": "Adversaries may evade detection and prolong execution by launching commands that ignore process interrupt signals. Most operating systems support signals (like `SIGHUP`) that control process behavior, including termination during session disconnection. Utilities like `nohup` (Linux/macOS) or PowerShell's `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` (Windows) can allow a process to continue running even after a user logs out or an error occurs. While this doesn't provide persistence like the Trap technique, it enables malicious processes to avoid being terminated under normal system interruption conditions.",
