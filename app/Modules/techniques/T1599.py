        "description": "Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by compromising perimeter network devices or internal devices responsible for segmentation. Devices such as routers and firewalls are typically used to restrict traffic types, enforce organizational policies, and maintain segmentation between trusted and untrusted zones. \n\nOnce compromised, these devices can be reconfigured to allow unauthorized traffic to cross boundaries. This allows adversaries to bypass policy enforcement mechanisms and enables further adversarial goals such as lateral movement, command and control via [Multi-hop Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/003), or exfiltration using [Traffic Duplication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1020/001). \n\nIn environments where border devices separate distinct organizations or enclaves, this bridging capability could extend attacks across enterprise boundaries. Internal segmentation points can also be manipulated in conjunction with [Internal Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/001) to maintain stealthy access and expand control.",
