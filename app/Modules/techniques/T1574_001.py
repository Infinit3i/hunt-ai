### SANS DFIR Insights
- Nearly all DLL hijacks require placing a new DLL or executable onto the file system.
- Investigative Techniques:
    - **File Timeline Analysis**:
        - Focus on newly created files during times of interest.
    - **Memory Forensics**:
        - Analyze running processes for unexpected DLL locations.
- Obscure DLLs are more likely to be targeted since common DLLs are usually preloaded into memory.
- Other anomalous actions like network beaconing or named pipe creation can lead to detection.
