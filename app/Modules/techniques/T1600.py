        "description": "Adversaries may compromise a network device’s encryption capability to bypass protections that would otherwise secure data communications. This may involve manipulating encryption mechanisms such as algorithm selection, key strength, or hardware acceleration modules.\n\nEncryption ensures confidentiality and integrity of network traffic, using algorithms that convert plaintext into ciphertext. Strong encryption relies on sufficient key sizes and hardened implementations. By weakening these elements—such as through [Modify System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601), [Reduce Key Space](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1600/001), or [Disable Crypto Hardware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1600/002)—an adversary may enable traffic decryption, unauthorized access, or data manipulation.\n\nThese tactics pose serious risks, especially on network devices like routers and firewalls that mediate vast amounts of sensitive traffic. Weakened encryption may assist in Credential Access, Collection, and broader eavesdropping activities.",
