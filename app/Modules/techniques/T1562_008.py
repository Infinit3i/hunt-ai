        "description": "An adversary may disable or modify cloud logging capabilities and integrations to limit what data is collected on their activities and avoid detection. Cloud environments allow for collection and analysis of audit and application logs that provide insight into user activity. If an adversary has sufficient permissions, they may disable or tamper with logging to conceal malicious actions.\n\nFor example, in AWS, adversaries may disable CloudTrail or CloudWatch integrations. They might also remove SNS topics, disable multi-region logging, or alter validation/encryption settings for logs. In Office 365, adversaries may disable mail activity logging for specific users using `Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation`, downgrade licenses to remove advanced auditing, or disable relevant settings. These actions hinder detection and forensic investigation capabilities.",
