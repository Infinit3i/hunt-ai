This includes assets acquired via [Develop Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587) or [Obtain Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588), and staged via infrastructure obtained through [Acquire Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583) or [Compromise Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584).\n\nStaging may occur on cloud platforms, public code repositories (e.g., GitHub), paste sites (e.g., Pastebin), decentralized services (e.g., IPFS), or Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solutions. These staged capabilities can later be used in a variety of operations, such as:\n\n- Hosting drive-by malware for [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189)\n- Setting up phishing link targets for [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598/003)\n- Uploading payloads to support [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)\n- Installing SSL/TLS certificates for encrypted C2 via [Asymmetric Cryptography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/002)",
