        "description": 'Adversaries may compromise third-party infrastructure that can be used during targeting. Infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, domains, network devices, and third-party web and DNS services. Instead of buying, leasing, or renting infrastructure, an adversary may compromise infrastructure and use it during other phases of the adversary lifecycle.(Citation: Mandiant APT1)(Citation: ICANNDomainNameHijacking)(Citation: Talos DNSpionage Nov 2018)(Citation: FireEye EPS Awakens Part 2) Additionally, adversaries may compromise numerous machines to form a botnet they can leverage. Use of compromised infrastructure allows adversaries to stage, launch, and execute operations while blending in with traffic that is seen as normal or trusted, potentially incorporating digital certificates. Adversaries may also compromise infrastructure to support proxy/proxyware services.(Citation: amnesty_nso_pegasus)(Citation: Sysdig Proxyjacking) By using compromised infrastructure, adversaries may make attribution more difficult, and in some cases they may even compromise the infrastructure of other adversaries prior to targeting.(Citation: NSA NCSC Turla OilRig)',
