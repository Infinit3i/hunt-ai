            "Adversaries may compromise third-party Virtual Private Servers (VPSs) to facilitate malicious "
            "operations. By compromising a VPS owned by another entity, adversaries can leverage existing "
            "infrastructure and make it more difficult to attribute activity to themselves. These compromised "
            "VPSs can be used to host Command and Control (C2) or other malicious services, benefiting from "
            "the trust and ubiquity of reputable cloud service providers as well as the VPS ownerâ€™s reputation."
