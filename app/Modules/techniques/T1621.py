        "description": "Adversaries may attempt to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms by triggering repeated authentication requests, typically via push notifications. This tactic, known as 'MFA fatigue', involves bombarding the user with login prompts until the user unintentionally or mistakenly approves the request. In addition to deliberate misuse of stolen credentials, adversaries may exploit self-service password reset (SSPR) features to trigger MFA requests.",
