Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are stored in predictable paths such as `\\\\<DOMAIN>\\SYSVOL\\<DOMAIN>\\Policies\\`, and they control how user and computer configurations are applied across Active Directory environments. Tools like `gpresult`, `Get-DomainGPO`, and `Get-DomainGPOLocalGroup` can reveal configurations, group memberships, and local administrator setups that may present opportunities for lateral movement or privilege escalation.",
