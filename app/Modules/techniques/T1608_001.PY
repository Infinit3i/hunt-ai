        "description": "Adversaries may upload malware to adversary-controlled or third-party infrastructure to make it accessible for later use during targeting or compromise. This can include staging payloads, droppers, backdoors, or other components needed for execution within victim environments. Malware may be hosted to support [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105) or [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204).\n\nMalicious files can be placed on attacker-controlled infrastructure obtained via [Acquire Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583) or [Compromise Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584). Malware can also be uploaded to services like GitHub, Pastebin, or decentralized storage systems such as IPFS, which make takedown efforts more difficult.\n\nSome adversaries upload backdoored software artifacts—like modified virtual machine images, installers, or Docker containers—to public repositories. These may be mistaken for legitimate software and executed by users through [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036), enabling initial access or persistent compromise.",
