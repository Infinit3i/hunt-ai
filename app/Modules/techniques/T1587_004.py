        "description": "Adversaries may develop their own exploits to leverage in various stages of an intrusion. Exploit development may involve identifying and testing vulnerabilities, such as through fuzzing or patch analysis, and may require specialized skills in-house or via contractors. These exploits can be used against public-facing applications, for client execution, or for privilege escalation and defense evasion.",  # Simple description
