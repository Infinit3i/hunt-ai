        "description": "Adversaries may buy, steal, or download malware that can be used during targeting. This malware may range from simple droppers to complex modular implants, and can include payloads, post-exploitation tools, or Command and Control (C2) frameworks. Malware is often acquired from third-party developers, underground marketplaces, or reused from open-source or leaked repositories. Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) platforms offer professionalized delivery, often including support infrastructure, obfuscation, and payload customization.",
